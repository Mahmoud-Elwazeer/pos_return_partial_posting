## üßæ How to Use Partial Posting for Return POS Invoices

This feature allows you to process return POS invoices with **stock-only posting**, skipping accounting entries initially, and completing them later via manual payment entry.

### üîÅ Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Create a Return POS Invoice**
    - Go to the POS interface and create a return invoice as usual.
    - Open the return invoice in **Form View**.
2. **Enable Partial Posting**
    - Enable the checkbox labeled `Partial Posting (Stock Only)` (see screenshot for reference).
    - This ensures only stock entries are posted at first, without any GL (General Ledger) entries.
3. **Submit the Return POS Invoice**
    - Submit the invoice like any other.
    - When the **POS Closing Entry** is submitted, the system will merge the invoice and generate a corresponding **Sales Invoice** (of type Return).
4. **Check the Stock Update**
    - Go to **Stock Entry** to verify that stock quantities have been updated as per the return.
    - No accounting (GL) entries will be created at this point.
5. **Record Manual Payment**
    - Navigate to **Accounts > Payment Entry**.
    - Create a new Payment Entry manually:
        - Select the **Customer**.
        - In the reference table, link the previously generated **Sales Invoice**.
        - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: In the *Reference No.* field, enter the number of the Sales Invoice to ensure it links correctly.
    - Submit the payment.
6. **Final Result**
    - After submitting the Payment Entry, the **General Ledger** will be updated.
    - At this point, both the **Sales Invoice** and **Payment Entry** are reflected properly in accounting.
